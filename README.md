# Convolution-Network-CIFAR10-Image-classification
 
 This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
 
 ## Overview
 
 The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This project demonstrates a basic CNN architecture to classify these images.
 
 ## Features
 
 *   **CNN Architecture:** Utilizes convolutional layers, max pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected layers.
 *   **ReLU Activation:**  Employs ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions for non-linearity.
 *   **Batch Normalization:** Implements batch normalization to improve training stability and speed.
 *   **Data Augmentation:** (Optional, but can be easily added - see "Future Improvements") Could be integrated to improve generalization.
 *   **Training History Visualization:**  Plots training and validation accuracy and loss.
